### Golang Guide
___

#### TODO: redefine and finalize the repo's `readme.md`.

This project is a simple guide for golang. It is not a complete guide, but it is a good starting point. It contains some basic information about golang, and some tips and tricks for getting started, moreover, a collection of some projects that I have created for a beginner to try, and see how they work. All the source code is available on under the `src` folder.

- [GO doc](https://go.dev/doc/)
- [GO `src`](https://github.com/michalspano/golang-guide/tree/main/src)

Using the `Go` __CLI__:

### Run a `Go` file

```sh
$ go run src.go
```

## Compile a `Go` file into a `bin`

```sh
$ go build src.go
```

#### Execute binary
```sh
$ ./src
```

### Compile a `Go` file into the `bin` directory
```sh
$ go install src.go
```
